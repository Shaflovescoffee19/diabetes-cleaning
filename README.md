# Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering -> Diabetes Dataset

Raw medical data is almost never ready for modelling. This project takes a widely-used clinical dataset full of real-world messiness, impossible zero values masquerading as missing data, outliers that could distort every downstream analysis, and raw measurements that don't yet capture the biology they're meant to represent, and transforms it into a clean, feature-rich dataset ready for machine learning.

## 🗂️ The Dataset

The Pima Indians Diabetes dataset records clinical measurements from female patients of Pima Indian heritage -> a population with elevated rates of type 2 diabetes. The dataset presents a classic real-world data quality problem: five features use zero as a placeholder for missing measurements, which is biologically impossible for values like blood pressure, BMI, and glucose. Accepting these zeros at face value would corrupt any model trained on the data.

**Features:**
`Pregnancies` · `Glucose` · `BloodPressure` · `SkinThickness` · `Insulin` · `BMI` · `DiabetesPedigreeFunction` · `Age`

## 🔧 Cleaning Pipeline

### Step 1: Detecting Impossible Zeros
Five columns cannot legitimately be zero in a living patient: `Glucose`, `BloodPressure`, `SkinThickness`, `Insulin`, `BMI`. Zero entries in these columns are missing values entered as zeros, a common data entry convention in older clinical datasets.

| Feature | Zero Count | % of Records |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| Glucose | 5 | 0.7% |
| BloodPressure | 35 | 4.6% |
| SkinThickness | 227 | 29.6% |
| Insulin | 374 | 48.7% |
| BMI | 11 | 1.4% |

Insulin is missing for nearly half the dataset, naive deletion would lose almost half the data entirely.

### Step 2: Group-Wise Median Imputation
Rather than replacing missing values with the overall column median, missing values are imputed separately within each outcome group (diabetic vs non-diabetic). This preserves the class-specific distributions, diabetic patients have characteristically different insulin and glucose profiles, and pooling the two groups for imputation would dilute that signal.

### Step 3: Outlier Detection and Capping
IQR-based outlier detection flags values below Q1 − 1.5×IQR or above Q3 + 1.5×IQR. Rather than removing entire rows (which loses other valid measurements), extreme values are capped at the IQR boundaries. This neutralises distortion while keeping every patient in the dataset.

### Step 4: Feature Engineering
Four new features are derived from existing measurements to better capture the underlying biology:

| New Feature | Derivation | Rationale |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| `BMI_Category` | BMI binned into Underweight / Normal / Overweight / Obese | Captures the non-linear risk jump at obesity threshold |
| `Age_Group` | Age binned into Young / Middle / Senior | Captures age-related risk stages |
| `Glucose_Category` | Glucose binned into Normal / Prediabetic / Diabetic range | Directly encodes clinical glucose classification |
| `Glucose_Insulin_Ratio` | Glucose ÷ Insulin | Proxy for insulin resistance — a key diabetes mechanism |

### Step 5: Scaling and Splitting
Min-Max scaling applied to all numerical features, followed by an 80/20 stratified train/test split. Stratification ensures the proportion of diabetic patients is preserved in both splits.

## 🔍 Key Findings

- Glucose is the strongest predictor of diabetes outcome (Pearson r ≈ 0.49) -> both before and after cleaning
- Obese patients show dramatically higher diabetes rates than overweight or normal BMI patients -> the engineered `BMI_Category` captures this threshold effect that raw BMI misses
- Insulin was missing for 48.7% of records -> group-wise median imputation recovers this signal without introducing bias toward either class
- The `Glucose_Insulin_Ratio` interaction feature captures insulin resistance patterns invisible in either feature individually
